# responsive-portfolio

For this project i was required to make a responsive web portfilio using twitters bootstrap.
This project wasn't to challanging but finding the required components in the documentation was definatly a plus.
Did have some trouble getting the website to scale at different sizes properly, but using stack overflow definaly helped with that.
Another problem i incured was that i forgot to add the javascript to make the nav bar work.
